**INQUA 2019 is  the congress of the International Union for Quaternary Research.**

With Dr. Niamh Cahill and Prof. Andrew Parnell I co-convened a session on 
[Bayesian statistical analysis methods for paleoclimate data](https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/events/574/program-app/session/4680). 
This session was very successful in that we had a full room and 6 great talks, along with a poster session. Hopefully we managed to convince
some of the audience that Bayesian methodology is the way to go for inverse problems such as climate reconstruction with multiple sources
of uncertainty!

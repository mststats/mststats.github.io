I am a named supervisor in two new **Centre's for Research Training** funded by **Science Foundation Ireland**: 

- [Foundations in Data Science](http://data-science.ie/)
- [Genomics Data Science](http://genomicsdatascience.ie/)

These offer the fantastic opportunity to enter a fully funded PhD programme with a large cohort of other PhD candidates.

# Biography
I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics in University College Dublin since Jan 2017. 
My official UCD page is <a href="https://people.ucd.ie/michael.salter-townshend">here</a>
and the icons to the left offer links to some online accounts I use. 


My research spans population genetics, network analysis, palaeoclimate reconstruction, and sentiment analysis. 
See my publications below for more information or browse by topic by clicking projects above. 

I'm particularly interested in modelling patterns of shared genetic variation in datasets with population structure. 
Contact me if you have challenging datasets that you'd like to model!

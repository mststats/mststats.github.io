# Biography
I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics in University College Dublin since Jan 2017. 
My UCD research page is <a href="http://www.ucd.ie/research/people/mathematicsstatistics/drmichaelsalter-townshend/">here</a>
and the icons to the left offer links to other online accounts I use. 


My primary research interest is in population genetics, with a focus on human genomes. This involves modelling the patterns of shared variation between individuals and can shed light on questions of human demographic history, natural selection, and disease association mapping. My particular focus is on building sophisticated models for admixture; this is when two or more previously diverged sub-populations come together and it leads to interesting structure in the DNA of ancestors of the mixing groups. To this end I'm building extensions to some existing Hidden Markov Models for population genetics. 

I'm also active in several other areas of applied computational statistics, including social network analysis and palaeoclimate reconstruction. See my publications for more information. 

I spent 3 years as a postdoc working with Prof. Simon Myers in the University of Oxford where I was also a Junior Research Fellow at Mansfield College from 2014 to 2016. 

Before this, I was a postoc with Prof. Brendan Murphy in UCD, Dublin on a network analysis project as part of Clique. Clique was an SFI funded multidisciplinary research cluster on network analysis. I worked on developing computationally efficient models for various types of network model. I developed Variational Bayesian methods and also used MCMC and EM algorithms. 

My PhD was with Prof. John Haslett in Trinity College Dublin on a palaeoclimate reconstruction project. During my PhD I spent time working with Havard Rue in NTNU, Trondheim developing algorithms for Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations to the hierarchical Bayesian model used for palaeoclimate reconstruction.

The enrichment of such clusters over various distantly related bacteria can be used to predict the roles of genes of unknown function that cluster with characterised genes. There is no obvious rule to define a cluster, given their variability in size and intergenic distances, and the definition of what comprises a “gene”, since genes can gain and lose domains over time. Protein domains can cluster within a gene, or in adjacent genes of related function, and in both cases these are chromosomally clustered. Here, we model the distances between pairs of protein domain coding regions across a wide range of bacteria and archaea via a probabilistic two component mixture model, without imposing arbitrary thresholds in terms of gene numbers or distances.  Results: We trained our model using matched Gene Ontology terms to label functionally related pairs and assess the stability of the parameters of the model across 14, 178 archaeal and bacterial strains. We found that the parameters of our mixture model are remarkably stable across bacteria and archaea, except for endosymbionts and obligate intracellular pathogens. Obligate pathogens have smaller genomes, and although they vary, on average do not show noticeably different clustering distances; the main difference in the parameter estimates is that a far greater proportion of the genes sharing ontology terms are clustered. This may reflect that these genomes are enriched for complexes encoded by clustered core housekeeping genes, as a proportion of the total genes. Given the overall stability of the parameter estimates, we then used the mean parameter estimates across the entire dataset to investigate which gene ontology terms are most frequently associated with clustered genes.  Conclusions: Given the stability of the mixture model across species, it may be used to predict bacterial gene clusters that are shared across multiple species, in addition to giving insights into the evolutionary pressures on the chromosomal locations of genes in different species.","tags":null,"title":"Computational modelling of Chromosomally Clustering Protein Domains In Bacteria","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James A Ward","Gillian P McHugo","Michael J Dover","Thomas J Hall","Said I Ng'ang'a","Tad S Sonstegard","Daniel G Bradley","Laurent AF Frantz","Michael Salter-Townshend","David E MacHugh"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1630450800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630450800,"objectID":"a2987abd02933ac4d739305a2d29e45d","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/publication/cattle_nmt/","publishdate":"2021-09-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cattle_nmt/","section":"publication","summary":"Domestic cattle have a key economic role in African societies, providing an important source of mobile wealth through supply of meat, milk, cowhide, fuel, transport, and traction. The phenotypic diversity of African cattle reflects adaptation to a wide range of agroecological conditions and complex patterns of admixture between the humpless Bos taurus (taurine) and humped Bos indicus (zebu) subspecies, which share a common ancestor 150-500 thousand years ago. Human migration and trade from Asia have left a peak of zebu nuclear ancestry in East Africa and most cattle populations across the continent have a hybrid genetic composition. Notwithstanding this, all African cattle possess taurine mitochondrial haplotypes, even populations with significant zebu nuclear ancestry. In this regard, the efficient functioning of the mitochondrion relies on a network of biochemical interactions between the products of 37 mitochondrial genes and more than one thousand nuclear genes; therefore, admixed African cattle represent ideal populations for evaluating mitonuclear interactions and mismatch between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Using high-density SNP array data from 18 different cattle populations, including ten African admixed breeds, we find strong evidence for mitonuclear coevolution in hybrid African cattle with significant retention of Bos taurus alleles at mitochondrially-targeted nuclear genes, particularly those genes with products that directly interact with mtDNA-encoded protein subunits in OXPHOS and ribosomal complexes, or that have functions in mtDNA replication. We also show that subspecific local ancestry varies substantially across the genomes of admixed populations, with a marked signal of taurine ancestry at the major histocompatibility (MHC) gene cluster, which likely reflects adaptation to infectious disease challenges facing African livestock. Our results demonstrate that African admixed cattle represent an excellent comparative model for studying the phenotypic consequences of mitonuclear mismatch and genomic introgression in humans and other large mammals.","tags":null,"title":"Genome-wide local ancestry and direct evidence for mitonuclear co-adaptation in African hybrid cattle populations (Bos taurus/indicus)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Chiara Controneo, Denis Shields, Claire Gormley, and I have written a paper on Computational modelling of Chromosomally Clustering Protein Domains In Bacteria.\nClick the tweet below to see a brief explainer thread.\nNew #preprint on finding gene clusters occurring across bacterial strains with @selenocysteina @denshields and @icgormley https://t.co/nvfiDNKkFP\n\u0026mdash; M.

We\u0026rsquo;re particularly interested in something called \u0026ldquo;admixture\u0026rdquo;, which is when two or more previously separated populations come together, typically due to migration or the removal of some other barrier ^[e.g. cultural or religious] to procreation between the groups. By examining modern genetic samples, we report evidence for such admixture globally and persistently, reflecting the importance of migration in shaping modern human populations.\nOur method, which we term MOSAIC, ^[MOSAIC stands for \u0026ldquo;MOSAIC Organises Segments of Ancestry In Chromosomes\u0026rdquo;] allows for the decryption of how such admixture events unfolded; i.e. which groups mixed, in what ratios, and when did this happen? It relies only on modern genetic samples to achieve this and crucially does not require assumptions about how these modern samples might relate to the unseen ancient (ad)mixing groups ^[or are descended either directly or indirectly from]. Previous methods exclusively rely on known ^[or assumed known\u0026hellip;] direct correspondence between modern populations and the mixing ancestor groups, whereas MOSAIC makes inference on potentially complex patterns of relatedness, based only on the data. This is achieved by fitting a flexible model ^[specifically a two-layer (a.k.a. coupled a.k.a. nested) Hidden Markov Model] of \u0026ldquo;haplotype copying\u0026rdquo;; this is essentially a method that ranks how closely related each stretch of chromosome in each individual is to the chromosome stretches in individuals from other populations ^[Such models are often referred to as Li and Stephens models after Li and Stephens 2003. Essentially, this forms the lower layer of our two-layer Hidden Markov Model.]. Not only does MOSAIC infer how and when admixture arose within a population, but it attributes \u0026ldquo;local ancestry\u0026rdquo; to every part of every chromosome for each individual in the dataset.\nWe analyse 95 modern populations using this new approach and identify previously unknown admixture events. Highlight findings include the discovery of a complex 4-way admixture in San-Khomani individuals from South Africa. We also show that Eastern European populations possess between 1% and 3% ancestry from a group resembling modern-day central Asians. In addition the method identifies evidence of recent natural selection favouring sub-Saharan ancestry at the \u0026ldquo;HLA\u0026rdquo; region, ^[The Human Leukocyte Antigen is a gene complex that includes many proteins responsible for regulation of the immune system and are therefore a region of the genome upon which natural selection is believed to act] across North African individuals.\n  Read the new paper here for full details.\n  See The MOSAIC Project Website for an interactive results browser, manual, and source code.\n  Bullet Point Summary  By examining modern genetic samples from around the world, we can demonstrate that observed \u0026ldquo;populations\u0026rdquo; are really a mixture of older populations. Such mixing events occur globally and throughout history and can be complex, and sudden or ongoing. We have developed a new tool that can probe such events back in time using the patterns left on modern DNA samples by such events. The key contribution is that we do not require specification of surrogate \u0026ldquo;reference populations\u0026rdquo; for the mixing ancestral groups. More accurate characterisation of admixture than previously possible is demonstrated in a variety of situations. We identify previously unknown admixture events including a complex 4-way admixture in San-Khomani individuals from Southern Africa. We show that Eastern European populations possess 1% to 3% ancestry from a group resembling modern-day central Asians. We identify evidence of recent natural selection favouring sub-Saharan ancestry at the HLA region, across North African individuals. Results for all 95 analysed populations are viewable through a browser at https://maths.ucd.ie/~mst/MOSAIC/HGDP_browser).  Additional Detail All populations are admixed when you look at the right time depth and compare to the right mixing sources. In other words, admixture is pervasive and\n there\u0026rsquo;s no such thing as a \u0026ldquo;pure\u0026rdquo; European - or anyone else (Gibbons, 2016).^[Nor has there ever been; ancient DNA shows that much older populations were no exception (Jeong et al, 2019).]\n When a population is isolated ^[even partially isolated] from other populations random genetic differences between them accrue; the longer the separation, the more \u0026ldquo;drifted\u0026rdquo; these populations become from each other. Eventually, given enough such differences, we can statistically tell one group from another and assign (albeit noisily) an individual to a population based on which mutations they might carry. Such \u0026ldquo;population structure\u0026rdquo; has been shown to mirror geography for example.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been shown before that admixture (the coming together of previously separated populations) is a feature of many human populations (Hellenthal et al, 2014). Through sophisticated statistical procedures, heavily informed by known biology, ^[The process of chromosomal recombination means that individuals inherit shorter segments from each ancestral source with each passing generation since the admixture event.] the demographic history can be inferred by careful examination of the telltale patterns of shared genetic variation within and between such populations.\nThis is possible because the distribution of these ancestral segments (were they known) would enable us to estimate when the event(s) took place and what proportion of each source was involved. Although we don\u0026rsquo;t get to directly observe the ancestry of these segments, we can accurately infer them when we have \u0026ldquo;reference\u0026rdquo; populations to compare to ^[something called \u0026ldquo;chromosome painting\u0026rdquo;]. For such a direct approach to work, these reference populations need to be good surrogates for the (ad)mixing groups. However, since we use modern populations, they\u0026rsquo;ll typically be drifted somewhat themselves ^[with respect to the mixing groups] and perhaps even admixed with other populations, hence not direct surrogates. This has formed a central challenge in fitting admixture models and motivates the need for our new approach.\nOur new tool, MOSAIC, is novel in that we replace knowledge of these direct surrogates with a more flexible model. The model not only allows for more complex relationships between observed surrogates and the unseen mixing ancestral groups, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t require prior knowledge of these relationships. Rather, we let the data do the talking and make estimates of \u0026ldquo;copying probabilities\u0026rdquo; that can adapt to the observed complexity as required ^[MOSAIC also finds estimates of the level of drift between the observed modern populations and the mixing ancestral groups]. This also allows us to use more reference populations; whereas an admixed population would be unsuitable for use by a tool that assumes reference populations are direct surrogates for mixing groups, ^[as they will be heavily confounded by this] MOSAIC not only allows this but it can boost the power of the method. ^[compared to leaving such a reference population out of the analysis. In fact MOSAIC can return accurate local ancestry estimates and thus accurate admixture summaries when one or more ancestries has no good direct surrogates among the reference populations. For example, when it is only observed in admixed form, which is particularly common when looking at older admixture events.] MOSAIC is shown to yield more accurate results than previously possible and can be applied to any sexually reproducing species.\n","date":1561417200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561417200,"objectID":"e0fb28928250ebf96bccf56b59dbb9ea","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/post/mosaic/","publishdate":"2019-06-25T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/mosaic/","section":"post","summary":"A paper I wrote with [Prof. Simon Myers](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~myers) on admixture was chosen by the [GENETICS](https://www.genetics.org/) Editors as one of the July 2019 Highlights.","tags":["publications","genetics"],"title":"New Paper out in GENETICS","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Eurodeer is a scientific network for data and knowledge sharing on wild roe deer populations.\nI was honoured to give a keynote talk on Social Network Analysis to a group of conservation biologists and others working in the area of monitoring and researching wild animal movements.

In social networks, this means that individuals form multiple types of relationships with the same person (e.g., an individual will not trust all of his/her acquaintances).

In this paper, we propose a statistical framework that parsimoniously represents dependence between relationship types while also maintaining enough flexibility to allow individuals to serve different roles in different relationship types. Our approach builds on work on latent space models for networks [see, e.g., J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 97 (2002) 1090–1098]. These models represent the propensity for two individuals to form edges as conditionally independent given the distance between the individuals in an unobserved social space. Our work departs from previous work in this area by representing dependence structure between network views through a multivariate Bernoulli likelihood, providing a representation of between-view association.

The structural properties of these networks are studied using ideas from social network theory. We develop three hypotheses about how network structures influence project effectiveness and examine the hypotheses using a longitudinal dataset of 362 WikiProjects. The evaluation suggests that an intermediate level of cohesion with a core of influential users dominating network flow improves effectiveness for a WikiProject, and that greater average membership tenure relates to project efficiency in a positive way. We discuss the implications of this analysis for the future management of WikiProjects.","tags":null,"title":"The influence of network structures of Wikipedia discussion pages on the efficiency of WikiProjects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Salter-Townshend","Thomas Brendan Murphy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1428015600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1428015600,"objectID":"720accb5246dcbe6855f7c287c4623a4","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/publication/ego-ergm/","publishdate":"2015-04-03T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ego-ergm/","section":"publication","summary":"This article introduces a novel and flexible framework for investigating the roles of actors within a network. Particular interest is in roles as defined by local network connectivity patterns, identified using the ego-networks extracted from the network. A mixture of exponential-family random graph models (ERGM) is developed for these ego-networks to cluster the nodes into roles. We refer to this model as the ego-ERGM. An expectation-maximization algorithm is developed to infer the unobserved cluster assignments and to estimate the mixture model parameters using a maximum pseudo-likelihood approximation. We demonstrate the flexibility and utility of the method using examples of simulated and real networks.","tags":null,"title":"Role analysis in networks using mixtures of exponential random graph models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brett A Becker","John Regan","Michael Salter-Townshend","Kevin Casey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1425168000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1425168000,"objectID":"3294e6e3ef0ce393d7287ac1e16f518f","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/publication/irish500/","publishdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/irish500/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Making a Case for an Irish500 List","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew C Parnell","James Sweeney","Thinh K Doan","Michael Salter‐Townshend","Judy RM Allen","Brian Huntley","John Haslett"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"9b33d7856771be773bd0a56910b5576c","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/publication/bpr-time/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bpr-time/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian inference for palaeoclimate with time uncertainty and stochastic volatility","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Salter-Townshend","Thomas Brendan Murphy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1393632000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1393632000,"objectID":"2dfdadb8f221eb325c79721b166d8a89","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/publication/mix-bias/","publishdate":"2014-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mix-bias/","section":"publication","summary":"Modelling bias is an important consideration when dealing with inexpert annotations. We are concerned with training a classifier to perform sentiment analysis on news media articles, some of which have been manually annotated by volunteers. The classifier is trained on the words in the articles and then applied to non-annotated articles. In previous work we found that a joint estimation of the annotator biases and the classifier parameters performed better than estimation of the biases followed by training of the classifier. An important question follows from this result: can the annotators be usefully clustered into either predetermined or data-driven clusters, based on their biases? If so, such a clustering could be used to select, drop or otherwise categorise the annotators in a crowdsourcing task. This paper presents work on fitting a finite mixture model to the annotators’ bias. We develop a model and an algorithm and demonstrate its properties on simulated data. We then demonstrate the clustering that exists in our motivating dataset, namely the analysis of potentially economically relevant news articles from Irish online news sources.","tags":null,"title":"Mixtures of biased sentiment analysers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiangju Qin","Michael Salter-Townshend","Padraig Cunningham"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1391040000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1391040000,"objectID":"658e1de16a74db7ef4179f493fd101b7","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/publication/icwsm/","publishdate":"2014-01-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icwsm/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Exploring the Relationship between Membership Turnover and Productivity in Online Communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Salter-Townshend","Thomas Brendan Murphy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1372633200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372633200,"objectID":"e3acc6bf6f047ebbe92e3e01110bca44","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/publication/sent-online-media/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/sent-online-media/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Sentiment Analysis of Online Media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Salter-Townshend","Thomas Brendan Murphy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1352332800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1352332800,"objectID":"c0ea89d1e65d069c094eb43625e137f7","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/publication/vblpcm/","publishdate":"2012-11-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vblpcm/","section":"publication","summary":"A number of recent approaches to modeling social networks have focussed on embedding the nodes in a latent “social space”. Nodes that are in close proximity are more likely to form links than those who are distant. This naturally accounts for reciprocal and transitive relationships which are commonly found in many network datasets. The Latent Position Cluster Model is one such model that also explicitly incorporates clustering by modeling the locations using a finite Gaussian mixture model. Observed covariates and sociality random effects may also be modeled. However, inference for the model via MCMC is cumbersome and thus scaling to large networks is a challenge. Variational Bayesian methods offer an alternative inference methodology for this problem. Sampling based MCMC is replaced by an optimization that requires many orders of magnitude fewer iterations to converge. A Variational Bayesian algorithm for the Latent Position Cluster Model is therefore developed and demonstrated.","tags":null,"title":"Variational Bayesian Inference for the Latent Position Cluster Model for network data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Salter‐Townshend","John Haslett"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351728000,"objectID":"f94c346d2615e182c6fd5ac00eee1770","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/publication/fast-inversion/","publishdate":"2012-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fast-inversion/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Fast inversion of a flexible regression model for multivariate pollen counts data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Salter-Townshend"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1347058800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1347058800,"objectID":"c295a01e88ceb819f15d2ba1dd14e163","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/publication/signif/","publishdate":"2012-09-08T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/signif/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Analysing my Facebook friends","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Salter‐Townshend","Arthur White","Isabella Gollini","Thomas Brendan Murphy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1335999600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1335999600,"objectID":"f7ee71f57c33e7d880651d348f88feec","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/publication/sna-review/","publishdate":"2012-05-03T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/sna-review/","section":"publication","summary":"The analysis of network data is an area that is rapidly growing, both within and outside of the discipline of statistics.

Such reconstructions promise to provide one of the few ways to validate modern models of climate change. A hierarchical Bayesian modelling approach is presented and its use, inversely, is demonstrated in a relatively small but statistically challenging exercise: the reconstruction of prehistoric climate at Glendalough in Ireland from fossil pollen. This computationally intensive method extends current approaches by explicitly modelling uncertainty and reconstructing entire climate histories. The statistical issues that are raised relate to the use of compositional data (pollen) with covariates (climate) which are available at many modern sites but are missing for the fossil data. The compositional data arise as mixtures and the missing covariates have a temporal structure. Novel aspects of the analysis include a spatial process model for compositional data, local modelling of lattice data, the use, as a prior, of a random walk with long‐tailed increments, a two‐stage implementation of the Markov chain Monte Carlo approach and a fast approximate procedure for cross‐validation in inverse problems. We present some details, contrasting its reconstructions with those which have been generated by a method in use in the palaeoclimatology literature. We suggest that the method provides a basis for resolving important challenging issues in palaeoclimate research. We draw attention to several challenging statistical issues that need to be overcome.","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian palaeoclimate reconstruction","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d2ef9b073d2afdb20c9aa1340b010fdf","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/project/other/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/other/","section":"project","summary":"Anything that doesn't have another home","tags":["machine-learning","sentiment","other"],"title":"Miscellaneous Projects","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"61e734ee14abc62d607b51f8df257ce4","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/project/sna/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sna/","section":"project","summary":"Analysis of data comprising links between nodes.","tags":["networks","computational","bayesian","machine-learning"],"title":"Network Analysis","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3a95be0c12616ca1e0ddfd69db1d750d","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/project/bpr/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bpr/","section":"project","summary":"Inferring past climates based on proxies such as pollen.","tags":["palaeo","bayesian","computational"],"title":"Palaeoclimate Reconstruction","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"41fc41f37142c9ad5a119922a4c54ee9","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/project/statgen/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/statgen/","section":"project","summary":"Statistical Analysis of genetics data, mostly focussing on Population Genetics.","tags":["genetics","computational"],"title":"Statistical Genetics","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7dc513b7ce8a1380be03f65f50db8137","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/project/text/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/text/","section":"project","summary":"Analysis of text, modelling both topic and sentiment.","tags":["machine-learning","sentiment","text","topics","bayesian"],"title":"Text / Topics / Sentiment","type":"project"}]

Despite extensive admixture, all African cattle possess taurine mitochondrial haplotypes, even populations with significant zebu biparental and male uniparental nuclear ancestry. This has been interpreted as the result of a human-mediated dispersal ultimately stemming from zebu bulls imported from South Asia during the last three millennia. Here we assess whether ancestry at mitochondrially-targeted nuclear genes in African admixed cattle is impacted by mitonuclear functional interactions. Using high-density SNP data, we find evidence for mitonuclear coevolution across hybrid African cattle populations with a significant increase of taurine ancestry at mitochondrially-targeted nuclear genes.

Understanding such variation is key to predicting inter- and intra-population variation across factors as diverse as gene flow, disease transmission, and resilience to climate change. Here, we use 3.5 years of observational data, coupled with static and dynamic methods in social network analysis, to investigate patterns of social association in wild giraffe in the northern Namib Desert, Namibia (a habitat of extreme aridity for the species). Our static analyses reveal similar robust nested social communities, but less distinct community structures, than those found in giraffe populations inhabiting less arid environments. Furthermore, results of our dynamic social network analyses show increased social connectivity in this population during the morning and hot-dry season. These temporal patterns align with patterns of thermoregulatory and sociosexual behaviour in this population. However, they differ from temporal patterns of connectivity revealed in populations in less arid environments. Combined, results of both our static and temporal analyses suggest that while the major characteristics of giraffe society persist through space and time, there is substantial variation in the strength of patterns of social connectivity both within and between populations at multiple spatiotemporal resolutions.","tags":null,"title":"Static and dynamic methods in social network analysis reveal the association patterns of desert-dwelling giraffe","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chiara E Cotroneo","Isobel Claire Gormley","Denis C Shields","Michael Salter-Townshend"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639353600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639353600,"objectID":"63913f9ce5d80d6ce6575c979ffc5e66","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/publication/chr-clust/","publishdate":"2021-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chr-clust/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: In bacteria, genes with related functions - such as those involved in the metabolism of the same compound or in infection processes - are often physically close on the genome and form groups called clusters. The enrichment of such clusters over various distantly related bacteria can be used to predict the roles of genes of unknown function that cluster with characterised genes. There is no obvious rule to define a cluster, given their variability in size and intergenic distances, and the definition of what comprises a “gene”, since genes can gain and lose domains over time. Protein domains can cluster within a gene, or in adjacent genes of related function, and in both cases these are chromosomally clustered. Here, we model the distances between pairs of protein domain coding regions across a wide range of bacteria and archaea via a probabilistic two component mixture model, without imposing arbitrary thresholds in terms of gene numbers or distances.  Results: We trained our model using matched Gene Ontology terms to label functionally related pairs and assess the stability of the parameters of the model across 14, 178 archaeal and bacterial strains. We found that the parameters of our mixture model are remarkably stable across bacteria and archaea, except for endosymbionts and obligate intracellular pathogens. Obligate pathogens have smaller genomes, and although they vary, on average do not show noticeably different clustering distances; the main difference in the parameter estimates is that a far greater proportion of the genes sharing ontology terms are clustered. This may reflect that these genomes are enriched for complexes encoded by clustered core housekeeping genes, as a proportion of the total genes. Given the overall stability of the parameter estimates, we then used the mean parameter estimates across the entire dataset to investigate which gene ontology terms are most frequently associated with clustered genes.  Conclusions: Given the stability of the mixture model across species, it may be used to predict bacterial gene clusters that are shared across multiple species, in addition to giving insights into the evolutionary pressures on the chromosomal locations of genes in different species.","tags":null,"title":"Computational modelling of Chromosomally Clustering Protein Domains In Bacteria","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Chiara Controneo, Denis Shields, Claire Gormley, and I have written a paper on Computational modelling of Chromosomally Clustering Protein Domains In Bacteria.\nClick the tweet below to see a brief explainer thread.\nAccepted for publication in BMC Bioinformatics 13-December-2021\nNew #preprint on finding gene clusters occurring across bacterial strains with @selenocysteina @denshields and @icgormley https://t.co/nvfiDNKkFP\n\u0026mdash; M.

We\u0026rsquo;re particularly interested in something called \u0026ldquo;admixture\u0026rdquo;, which is when two or more previously separated populations come together, typically due to migration or the removal of some other barrier ^[e.g. cultural or religious] to procreation between the groups. By examining modern genetic samples, we report evidence for such admixture globally and persistently, reflecting the importance of migration in shaping modern human populations.\nOur method, which we term MOSAIC, ^[MOSAIC stands for \u0026ldquo;MOSAIC Organises Segments of Ancestry In Chromosomes\u0026rdquo;] allows for the decryption of how such admixture events unfolded; i.e. which groups mixed, in what ratios, and when did this happen? It relies only on modern genetic samples to achieve this and crucially does not require assumptions about how these modern samples might relate to the unseen ancient (ad)mixing groups ^[or are descended either directly or indirectly from]. Previous methods exclusively rely on known ^[or assumed known\u0026hellip;] direct correspondence between modern populations and the mixing ancestor groups, whereas MOSAIC makes inference on potentially complex patterns of relatedness, based only on the data. This is achieved by fitting a flexible model ^[specifically a two-layer (a.k.a. coupled a.k.a. nested) Hidden Markov Model] of \u0026ldquo;haplotype copying\u0026rdquo;; this is essentially a method that ranks how closely related each stretch of chromosome in each individual is to the chromosome stretches in individuals from other populations ^[Such models are often referred to as Li and Stephens models after Li and Stephens 2003. Essentially, this forms the lower layer of our two-layer Hidden Markov Model.]. Not only does MOSAIC infer how and when admixture arose within a population, but it attributes \u0026ldquo;local ancestry\u0026rdquo; to every part of every chromosome for each individual in the dataset.\nWe analyse 95 modern populations using this new approach and identify previously unknown admixture events. Highlight findings include the discovery of a complex 4-way admixture in San-Khomani individuals from South Africa. We also show that Eastern European populations possess between 1% and 3% ancestry from a group resembling modern-day central Asians. In addition the method identifies evidence of recent natural selection favouring sub-Saharan ancestry at the \u0026ldquo;HLA\u0026rdquo; region, ^[The Human Leukocyte Antigen is a gene complex that includes many proteins responsible for regulation of the immune system and are therefore a region of the genome upon which natural selection is believed to act] across North African individuals.\n  Read the new paper here for full details.\n  See The MOSAIC Project Website for an interactive results browser, manual, and source code.\n  Bullet Point Summary  By examining modern genetic samples from around the world, we can demonstrate that observed \u0026ldquo;populations\u0026rdquo; are really a mixture of older populations. Such mixing events occur globally and throughout history and can be complex, and sudden or ongoing. We have developed a new tool that can probe such events back in time using the patterns left on modern DNA samples by such events. The key contribution is that we do not require specification of surrogate \u0026ldquo;reference populations\u0026rdquo; for the mixing ancestral groups. More accurate characterisation of admixture than previously possible is demonstrated in a variety of situations. We identify previously unknown admixture events including a complex 4-way admixture in San-Khomani individuals from Southern Africa. We show that Eastern European populations possess 1% to 3% ancestry from a group resembling modern-day central Asians. We identify evidence of recent natural selection favouring sub-Saharan ancestry at the HLA region, across North African individuals. Results for all 95 analysed populations are viewable through a browser at https://maths.ucd.ie/~mst/MOSAIC/HGDP_browser).  Additional Detail All populations are admixed when you look at the right time depth and compare to the right mixing sources. In other words, admixture is pervasive and\n there\u0026rsquo;s no such thing as a \u0026ldquo;pure\u0026rdquo; European - or anyone else (Gibbons, 2016).^[Nor has there ever been; ancient DNA shows that much older populations were no exception (Jeong et al, 2019).]\n When a population is isolated ^[even partially isolated] from other populations random genetic differences between them accrue; the longer the separation, the more \u0026ldquo;drifted\u0026rdquo; these populations become from each other. Eventually, given enough such differences, we can statistically tell one group from another and assign (albeit noisily) an individual to a population based on which mutations they might carry. Such \u0026ldquo;population structure\u0026rdquo; has been shown to mirror geography for example.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been shown before that admixture (the coming together of previously separated populations) is a feature of many human populations (Hellenthal et al, 2014). Through sophisticated statistical procedures, heavily informed by known biology, ^[The process of chromosomal recombination means that individuals inherit shorter segments from each ancestral source with each passing generation since the admixture event.] the demographic history can be inferred by careful examination of the telltale patterns of shared genetic variation within and between such populations.\nThis is possible because the distribution of these ancestral segments (were they known) would enable us to estimate when the event(s) took place and what proportion of each source was involved. Although we don\u0026rsquo;t get to directly observe the ancestry of these segments, we can accurately infer them when we have \u0026ldquo;reference\u0026rdquo; populations to compare to ^[something called \u0026ldquo;chromosome painting\u0026rdquo;]. For such a direct approach to work, these reference populations need to be good surrogates for the (ad)mixing groups. However, since we use modern populations, they\u0026rsquo;ll typically be drifted somewhat themselves ^[with respect to the mixing groups] and perhaps even admixed with other populations, hence not direct surrogates. This has formed a central challenge in fitting admixture models and motivates the need for our new approach.\nOur new tool, MOSAIC, is novel in that we replace knowledge of these direct surrogates with a more flexible model. The model not only allows for more complex relationships between observed surrogates and the unseen mixing ancestral groups, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t require prior knowledge of these relationships. Rather, we let the data do the talking and make estimates of \u0026ldquo;copying probabilities\u0026rdquo; that can adapt to the observed complexity as required ^[MOSAIC also finds estimates of the level of drift between the observed modern populations and the mixing ancestral groups]. This also allows us to use more reference populations; whereas an admixed population would be unsuitable for use by a tool that assumes reference populations are direct surrogates for mixing groups, ^[as they will be heavily confounded by this] MOSAIC not only allows this but it can boost the power of the method. ^[compared to leaving such a reference population out of the analysis. In fact MOSAIC can return accurate local ancestry estimates and thus accurate admixture summaries when one or more ancestries has no good direct surrogates among the reference populations. For example, when it is only observed in admixed form, which is particularly common when looking at older admixture events.] MOSAIC is shown to yield more accurate results than previously possible and can be applied to any sexually reproducing species.\n","date":1561420800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561420800,"objectID":"e0fb28928250ebf96bccf56b59dbb9ea","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/post/mosaic/","publishdate":"2019-06-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/mosaic/","section":"post","summary":"A paper I wrote with [Prof. Simon Myers](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~myers) on admixture was chosen by the [GENETICS](https://www.genetics.org/) Editors as one of the July 2019 Highlights.","tags":["publications","genetics"],"title":"New Paper out in GENETICS","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Eurodeer is a scientific network for data and knowledge sharing on wild roe deer populations.\nI was honoured to give a keynote talk on Social Network Analysis to a group of conservation biologists and others working in the area of monitoring and researching wild animal movements.

It has been shown that statistical methods based on Hidden Markov Models can accurately assign chromosomal segments of the admixed individuals to unseen ancestral populations, and simultaneously infer how these ancestral populations relate to observed modern populations. This has been accomplished in the context of high quality, phased haplotype data on many individuals, sampled from both the admixed target population and multiple extant reference populations. The most recent contributions in this area do not need to assume prior knowledge of the relationship between the unseen ancestral mixing groups and the reference panels. However, such methods have thus far not been extended to non-model organisms. Researchers in this area are increasingly reliant on low-coverage whole-genome sequencing data, for which genotypes are not called and a high rate of SNP missingness occurs. Versions of imputation and phasing algorithms do exist that allow for the replacement of called genotypes with genotype likelihoods, allowing for application to such data. We propose and outline an extension to existing models for multiway admixture that accounts for uncertainty in the genotypes and allows for a large rate of missing data. We demonstrate and assess the method by downsampling high coverage data. The approach will be especially useful in conservation genetics studies.","tags":null,"title":"Local Ancestry Inference in Non-Model Organisms","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Coincidences do happen.

In social networks, this means that individuals form multiple types of relationships with the same person (e.g., an individual will not trust all of his/her acquaintances). Statistical models for these data require understanding two related types of dependence structure: (i) structure within each relationship type, or network view, and (ii) the association between views. In this paper, we propose a statistical framework that parsimoniously represents dependence between relationship types while also maintaining enough flexibility to allow individuals to serve different roles in different relationship types. Our approach builds on work on latent space models for networks [see, e.g., J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 97 (2002) 1090–1098]. These models represent the propensity for two individuals to form edges as conditionally independent given the distance between the individuals in an unobserved social space. Our work departs from previous work in this area by representing dependence structure between network views through a multivariate Bernoulli likelihood, providing a representation of between-view association. This approach infers correlations between views not explained by the latent space model. Using our method, we explore 6 multiview network structures across 75 villages in rural southern Karnataka, India [Banerjee et al.

Nevertheless, when applied to large-scale and cross-platform behavioural data, existing approaches generally suffer from expressiveness, scalability and generality issues. This paper proposes trans-dimensional von Mises-Fisher (TvMF) mixture models for L2 normalised behavioural data, which encapsulate: (1) a Bayesian framework for vMF mixtures that enables prior knowledge and information sharing among clusters, (2) an extended version of reversible jump MCMC algorithm that allows adaptive changes in the number of clusters for vMF mixtures when the model parameters are updated, and (3) an online TvMF mixture model that accommodates the dynamics of clusters for time-varying user behavioural data. We develop efficient collapsed Gibbs sampling techniques for posterior inference, which facilitates parallelism for parameter updates. Empirical results on simulated and real-world data show that the proposed TvMF mixture models can discover more interpretable and intuitive clusters than other widely-used models, such as k-means, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture models (DP-GMM), and dynamic topic models (DTM). We further evaluate the performance of proposed models in real-world applications, such as the churn prediction task, that shows the usefulness of the features generated.","tags":null,"title":"Online Trans-dimensional von Mises-Fisher Mixture Models for User Profiles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["X.

We are concerned with training a classifier to perform sentiment analysis on news media articles, some of which have been manually annotated by volunteers. The classifier is trained on the words in the articles and then applied to non-annotated articles. In previous work we found that a joint estimation of the annotator biases and the classifier parameters performed better than estimation of the biases followed by training of the classifier. An important question follows from this result: can the annotators be usefully clustered into either predetermined or data-driven clusters, based on their biases? If so, such a clustering could be used to select, drop or otherwise categorise the annotators in a crowdsourcing task. This paper presents work on fitting a finite mixture model to the annotators’ bias. We develop a model and an algorithm and demonstrate its properties on simulated data. We then demonstrate the clustering that exists in our motivating dataset, namely the analysis of potentially economically relevant news articles from Irish online news sources.","tags":null,"title":"Mixtures of biased sentiment analysers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiangju Qin","Michael Salter-Townshend","Padraig Cunningham"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1391040000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1391040000,"objectID":"658e1de16a74db7ef4179f493fd101b7","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/publication/icwsm/","publishdate":"2014-01-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icwsm/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Exploring the Relationship between Membership Turnover and Productivity in Online Communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Salter-Townshend","Thomas Brendan Murphy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1372636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372636800,"objectID":"e3acc6bf6f047ebbe92e3e01110bca44","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/publication/sent-online-media/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sent-online-media/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Sentiment Analysis of Online Media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Salter-Townshend","Thomas Brendan Murphy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1352332800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1352332800,"objectID":"c0ea89d1e65d069c094eb43625e137f7","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/publication/vblpcm/","publishdate":"2012-11-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vblpcm/","section":"publication","summary":"A number of recent approaches to modeling social networks have focussed on embedding the nodes in a latent “social space”. Nodes that are in close proximity are more likely to form links than those who are distant. This naturally accounts for reciprocal and transitive relationships which are commonly found in many network datasets. The Latent Position Cluster Model is one such model that also explicitly incorporates clustering by modeling the locations using a finite Gaussian mixture model. Observed covariates and sociality random effects may also be modeled. However, inference for the model via MCMC is cumbersome and thus scaling to large networks is a challenge. Variational Bayesian methods offer an alternative inference methodology for this problem. Sampling based MCMC is replaced by an optimization that requires many orders of magnitude fewer iterations to converge. A Variational Bayesian algorithm for the Latent Position Cluster Model is therefore developed and demonstrated.","tags":null,"title":"Variational Bayesian Inference for the Latent Position Cluster Model for network data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Salter‐Townshend","John Haslett"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351728000,"objectID":"f94c346d2615e182c6fd5ac00eee1770","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/publication/fast-inversion/","publishdate":"2012-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fast-inversion/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Fast inversion of a flexible regression model for multivariate pollen counts data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Salter-Townshend"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1347062400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1347062400,"objectID":"c295a01e88ceb819f15d2ba1dd14e163","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/publication/signif/","publishdate":"2012-09-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/signif/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Analysing my Facebook friends","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Salter‐Townshend","Arthur White","Isabella Gollini","Thomas Brendan Murphy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1336003200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1336003200,"objectID":"f7ee71f57c33e7d880651d348f88feec","permalink":"https://mststats.github.io/publication/sna-review/","publishdate":"2012-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sna-review/","section":"publication","summary":"The analysis of network data is an area that is rapidly growing, both within and outside of the discipline of statistics.

Such reconstructions promise to provide one of the few ways to validate modern models of climate change. A hierarchical Bayesian modelling approach is presented and its use, inversely, is demonstrated in a relatively small but statistically challenging exercise: the reconstruction of prehistoric climate at Glendalough in Ireland from fossil pollen. This computationally intensive method extends current approaches by explicitly modelling uncertainty and reconstructing entire climate histories. The statistical issues that are raised relate to the use of compositional data (pollen) with covariates (climate) which are available at many modern sites but are missing for the fossil data. The compositional data arise as mixtures and the missing covariates have a temporal structure. Novel aspects of the analysis include a spatial process model for compositional data, local modelling of lattice data, the use, as a prior, of a random walk with long‐tailed increments, a two‐stage implementation of the Markov chain Monte Carlo approach and a fast approximate procedure for cross‐validation in inverse problems. We present some details, contrasting its reconstructions with those which have been generated by a method in use in the palaeoclimatology literature. We suggest that the method provides a basis for resolving important challenging issues in palaeoclimate research. We draw attention to several challenging statistical issues that need to be overcome.","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian palaeoclimate reconstruction","type":"publication"}]
